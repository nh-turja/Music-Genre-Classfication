# Music-Genre-Classfication
Genre classification is an important task for any music streaming/purchasing service as it helps to instantly classify songs in any given playlist or library by genre thus streamlining user experience. In this project, we build models to classify audio clips into one of the 8 different music genres using various machine learning approaches. 

Audio Signal pre-processing is done using the Librosa library in Python to Mel Scale and MFCC Spectrograms.

A general comparison is made between the performance of several classical machine learning models vs several neural network approaches.

Do look at the Project Presentation DS5220.pptx file for a presentation and details on the project and its results.
